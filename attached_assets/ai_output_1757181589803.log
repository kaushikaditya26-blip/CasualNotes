NBFCs have to keep at least 9% of the value of their risky loans and investments backed by solid money of their own — like share capital, reserves, and past profits kept aside.
But they cannot count “soft stuff” like goodwill, tax credits, money put into group companies, or unrealised paper gains, because those may not actually be available in a crisis.
This way, the CET1 ratio shows the genuine financial strength of the NBFC — the part that can actually absorb losses — instead of numbers boosted by accounting adjustments.

. Why You Should Care
Master Directions are your go-to strategic maps—essential for compliance in specific domains like NBFCs, foreign exchange, or AML.
Master Circulars act as the annual regulatory compendium, ensuring you’re up-to-date on service standards, prudential norms, and sector-specific lenses.

On August 07, 2025, SEBI introduced a landmark circular that reshapes the inspection
framework for intermediaries in the securities market.
Present Scenario:
Currently, brokers, depository participants (DPs), and clearing members are inspected
separately by each Market Infrastructure Institution (MII) i.e., Stock Exchanges, Depositories,
and Clearing Corporations.
•
This means a single entity holding multiple registrations could face three to four
different inspections in the same year.
•
Such repeated inspections often cause operational disruptions, require significant
manpower, and divert resources away from business activities.
•
It results in compliance fatigue for intermediaries, as they have to repeatedly prepare
for audits, respond to similar queries, and manage overlapping compliance demands.
The New Framework:
To address this challenge, SEBI has now introduced the concept of Joint Annual Inspections.
Instead of being inspected separately, an intermediary will undergo one consolidated
inspection that covers all its business segments
—
stockbroking, depository par
ticipant
activities, and clearing operations.
•
Depositories will oversee DP operations.
•
Clearing Corporations will focus on clearing activities.
•
Stock Exchanges will evaluate broking operation
