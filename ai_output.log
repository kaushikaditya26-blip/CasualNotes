Regulatory Background
On August 07, 2025, SEBI introduced a landmark circular that reshapes the inspection
framework for intermediaries in the securities market.
Present Scenario:
Currently, brokers, depository participants (DPs), and clearing members are inspected
separately by each Market Infrastructure Institution (MII) i.e., Stock Exchanges, Depositories,
and Clearing Corporations.
•
This means a single entity holding multiple registrations could face three to four
different inspections in the same year.
•
Such repeated inspections often cause operational disruptions, require significant
manpower, and divert resources away from business activities.
•
It results in compliance fatigue for intermediaries, as they have to repeatedly prepare
for audits, respond to similar queries, and manage overlapping compliance demands.
The New Framework:
To address this challenge, SEBI has now introduced the concept of Joint Annual Inspections.
Instead of being inspected separately, an intermediary will undergo one consolidated
inspection that covers all its business segments
—
stockbroking, depository par
ticipant
activities, and clearing operations.
•
Depositories will oversee DP operations.
•
Clearing Corporations will focus on clearing activities.
•
Stock Exchanges will evaluate broking

Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)
In Paragraph 11, the definition of “disadvantaged” now expressly
includes Persons with Disabilities (PwDs). Importantly, the
Directions mandate that:
•
No application for onboarding or periodic KYC updation
shall be rejected without due application of mind.
•
The reasons for rejection must be formally recorded by the
concerned officer.
This amendment is a significant step towards inclusive banking
practices and prevention of arbitrary denial of financial services
to PwDs.
3.
Expansion of KYC Requirement for Occasional Transactions
Paragraph 14 has been amended to extend KYC compliance
obligations to:
•
Occasional transactions of
₹
50,000 or more, whether
conducted as a single transaction or as multiple linked
transactions.

Of The
Mediation Process
At
Equator Resolution
, we often tell parties that mediation is not a halfway

it’s a place where conversations end with clarity, commitment, and
closure.
The
Kerala High Court
recently reinforced this truth in a case where two
matrimonial appeals sought to undo a settlement reached through court

annexed mediation. The parties had already agreed, signed, and allowed the
Family Court in Kannur to pass
a
compromise decree
. But
230 days later
,
they wanted to walk it back.
Their reason? They claimed the settlement was entered into by a Power of
Attorney holder without proper instructions, while one of them was
incapacitated due to a cardiac ailment.

The
Court
Said “

”
The Division Bench of
Justice Devan Ramachandran

Why This Case Matters
This is not just a technical dispute about legal provisions
but
it’s about the
fine balance between judicial oversight and regulatory independence. If courts
could freely compel SEBI to investigate, it might set a precedent that weakens
the regulator’s ability to decide its own priorities and methods.
For investors, it’s also a reminder that there are structured and lawful ways
to raise concerns about market misconduct. Complaints can be lodged on
SCORES, SEBI’s online grievance redressal system. They can be taken up
with SEBI’s grievance cell. If SEBI
issues an appealable order, the matter can
go to the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT). And if none of these options
provide relief, one can approach the High Court through a writ petition
,
but
even then, the court’s role is to ensure timely consideratio
n, not to dictate
investigative outcomes.
